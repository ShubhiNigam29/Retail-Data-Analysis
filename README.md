# Retail-Data-Analysis

Retail data demands analysis of all the components incorporated in a business, from sales, inventory, revenue to customer data, transaction details, and coupon codes promotions. Data-driven insights are quite beneficial and give an edge over competitors by tracking the history of customers’ purchase patterns to make smarter decisions in the impending time. This is what we leveraged in our models. Our aim is to build models which can derive useful insights and patterns from customer data like the product preference for purchase, time of the day/year when the sales were high, the stores which attract customers from particular zip codes, etc. The whole purpose for this exercise is to assist the stores to grow revenue and business’s profitability along with customer-centric experiences.
